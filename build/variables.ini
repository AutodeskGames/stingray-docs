# This file defines some variables that get automatically replaced in the doc during the build process.
# Note that mostly we only list the versions that are likely to change and are in more than one place.
# Each release, we should also verify the other material in the help. This includes especially:
# - the "Supported Platforms" page in the user help, which has many device versions
# - the Java versions and Android tools versions on the "Requirements for Android game development" page
# - the software requirements in the developer help (though most of these items are set using the variables below)
