# Alpha SDK Limitations

TODO:

-	it's an "alpha" release
-	help us make it better by trying it out and giving us feedback about what's missing for you to do what you want
-	Versioning is not fully set; we have a mechanism for versioning the APIs, but no promises yet about compatibility between releases
-	Platforms are currently limited; dynamic libraries are only supported on Windows (if you need other platforms, you can apply for source access)
