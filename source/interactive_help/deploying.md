# Deploying and Building

When you're ready to create a final, standalone package of your interactive application for one or more of your target platforms, you use the **Deployer** panel in the interactive editor. This panel helps you prepare and bundle all of your content up for each platform, packaging everything the game needs for you to distribute it.

The packaging process compiles and optimizes your game data for the target platform, and aggregates your resources into bundles according to the *.package* resources you have defined in your project. (See also ~{ About the content lifecycle }~.) The **Deployer** then performs additional packaging steps in order to produce a final build that contains all the necessary files and data to run the game.

When you're done, you'll have a standalone, self-contained application, with no dependencies on your own network or other local resources.
