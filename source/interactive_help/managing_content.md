# Managing Content and Resources

The topics in this section provide some more detailed information about how the {{ProductName}} content pipeline works, how resources are managed throughout your development process, and how you can keep under control the many, many resources that are needed by modern interactive and immersive experiences.

In particular, when your interactive app progresses past the stage of a simple prototype, you will almost certainly need to set up your own system for dynamically loading and unloading bundles of data at runtime. This is a key factor in keeping your app's memory requirements within the limitations of your target platform. For details, see ~{ Loading and unloading content at runtime }~.
