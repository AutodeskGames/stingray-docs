# Debugging and Profiling Wwise content

You can connect the Wwise authoring tool to a running instance of your interactive application. Once connected, you can see real time information in the profiler layout and the 3D object layout. The following features provide powerful audio workflows:

- The log shows all inputs to the Wwise engine, and any error message or warnings.
- You can get profiling information to monitor and debug performance.
- You can use a visual graph to see the state of all active Wwise objects.
- The 3D world viewer visualizes sources and events in real-time.
- Recording and playback allows for advanced debugging and mastering without needing to replay the game simulation.
