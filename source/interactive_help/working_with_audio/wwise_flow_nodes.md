# Wwise Flow nodes


The Wwise plug-in adds several Flow nodes for controlling Wwise content. In the Flow editor, see the **Wwise** section in the list of nodes.

The Wwise Flow nodes are available in the Wwise **Flow** menu.

These nodes are defined in the *core/wwise/wwise.script_flow_nodes* file.
