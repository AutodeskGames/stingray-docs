# Integrate Wwise content

## Boot package

Any interactive app that uses the Wwise integration must load the `content/audio/Init` *.wwise_dep* resource, which is automatically generated by the Wwise integration, in the boot package.

For example:

~~~{sjson}
wwise_dep = [
  "wwise/Init"
]
~~~

## Loading sound banks

In order to play a sound from a sound bank, you must load that sound bank into the engine at runtime. The bank can be loaded through Flow, Lua, or by adding its *.wwise_dep* resource to a resource package like the `Init` resource shown above.

See also ~{ Load sound banks at runtime }~.

## Listener

By default new projects are configured to move the Wwise listener 0 to the match the camera position. Search for `WwiseWorld.set_listener` in the Lua scripts to see where this is done, or to modify the implementation. The Lua API portion of the documentation has more information on the listener interface.
