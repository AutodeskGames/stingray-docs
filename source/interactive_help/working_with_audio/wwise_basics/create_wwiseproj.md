# Create or open a Wwise project

> ![](../../images/icon_video.png) You can also find a video tutorial on setting up your audio project [here](http://area.autodesk.com/learning/set-up-an-audio-project).

When you create a new {{ProductName}} project from one of the built-in ~{ Template projects }~, the {{ProductName}} editor automatically creates a new Wwise project. You can open this Wwise project in the Wwise authoring tool by selecting **Window > Wwise Audio** from the main menu in the interactive editor.

If you need to set up a new Wwise project for an existing {{ProductName}} project that doesn't have a corresponding Wwise project already, you can select **File > New Wwise Project**.

This creates a new Wwise project folder adjacent to the project folder, and configures it to export to the `content/audio` folder of your {{ProductName}} project.

To update the settings of your Wwise project such as export path and post generation steps, select **File > Settings > Update Wwise Project Settings**.
