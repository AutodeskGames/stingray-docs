# Wwise project

When the Wwise plug-in is enabled in the Stingray editor, new Stingray game projects are automatically set up for use with Wwise. A Wwise content project for the game project is created with the same name as the game project, followed by the `_wwise` suffix. It sits one level up from the game project folder.
