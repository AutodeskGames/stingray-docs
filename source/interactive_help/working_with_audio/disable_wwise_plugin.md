# Disable the Wwise plugin

If you don't need audio for your project, you can disable the Wwise integration.

Remove the `wwise` section from the project's `settings.ini` file, or set `enabled = false` within the `wwise` section.

Optionally, you can also remove any assets associated with your project in the "wwise" export folder and the Wwise content project folder.

See also the ~{ `settings.ini` file reference }~.
