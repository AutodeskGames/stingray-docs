#Create a texture category


You can use texture categories to organize textures and to do runtime tasks, such as dropping mip steps.

1. In the ~{ Texture Manager }~ (**Window > Texture Manager**), click *Create* icon ![](../../../images/icon_createAsset.png) and select **Create Category**.

2. In the dialog box that appears, browse to the location in your project where you want to store the texture category file and type a name to represent the category in the **Texture Manager**. Click Ok.

	Your texture category is added to **Category Filter** in the **Texture Manager** tool.
