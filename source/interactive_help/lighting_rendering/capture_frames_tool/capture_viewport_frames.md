# Capture frames to disk

The **Capture Frames** Tool lets you render frames to disk. The tool is integrated into the **Story Editor** workflow, and can also be initiated through Flow. For more information on using Flow, see the **Capture Frames** category in the [Flow Node Reference](../../../flow_ref/index.html).

## To capture frames

1. In the **Story Editor**, click ![](../../images/icon_capture_frame.png).

	 Story mode must be enabled before you can open the **Capture Frames** window.

2. In the **Capture Frames** window that appears, adjust the **Capture Options** to customize your capture. For more information, see ~{ Capture Frames Tool }~.

3. Click ![](../../images/icon_save.png) to save your changes, so they can be automatically applied to your next capture.

4. Click **Capture Frames**.

    The **Capture Level** window opens and the story plays from beginning to end, and the captured frames are saved in an .exr format to the selected **Output Directory**.

  >**Note:** Story can be set to be played in **Ping Pong** mode or **Loop** mode, but the **Capture Frames** Tool only supports forward or reverse, and not ping pong.
