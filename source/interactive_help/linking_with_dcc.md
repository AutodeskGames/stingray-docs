3ds Max Interactive Live Link is a powerful connection between 3ds Max and the Autodesk 3ds Max Interactive engine that streamlines your 3D asset creation process.

3ds Max Interactive Live Link makes it easier for professional and novice developers to bring content into the 3ds Max Interactive engine by linking directly with 3ds Max. It is the best way to update content shared between 3ds Max and 3ds Max Interactive software, as well as to send assets between the two. Designers can evaluate their assets from both ends, sending them back and forth seamlessly with Send Selection, Send All, or Update asset commands.

3ds Max Interactive Live Link includes:

-   integrated workflow to seamlessly send assets back and forth
-   connection status display
-   visual parity where any material created with 3ds Max Interactive physically-based nodes in ShaderFX are preserved when loaded in 3ds Max
-   viewport synchronization to quickly verify how models, animations, and materials appear in 3ds Max Interactive while you work in 3ds Max.
