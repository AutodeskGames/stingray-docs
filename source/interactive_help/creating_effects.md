# Creating FX

Creating beautiful and lasting impressions in an interactive 3D experience often requires special visual effects. Waterfalls, glow, depth of field, a gentle hazy fog, or particle trails - all are possible in {{ProductName}} and can give your scene that extra quality that's just not possible from standard polygonal modeling alone.

You can use particle effects to create an entire array of effects including but not limited to explosions, waterfalls, mist and smoke.

The shading environment settings let you create other types of global effects in your scene, including:

- Bloom

    Gives lights and emissive textures a glow or haze.

- Fog

    Gives a scene a simple atmosphere.

- Vignette

    Darkens the edging of your screen.

- Lens Quality (Distortion)

    Gives the scene a grainy "film" quality and emulates effects from a camera.

- Depth of Field

    Can blur things both closer and farther from a focal point.

- Motion Blur

    Gives objects in motion a realistic softening effect.
