# About 3ds Max Interactive

3ds Max Interactive helps you produce visually stunning, immersive, and interactive experiences of every kind.

It includes a real-time engine that you'll use to experience your 3D content on multiple platforms -- including desktop, mobile devices, game consoles, over the Web, and on virtual reality and augmented reality (VR & AR) devices. With the accompanying set of editing tools, you can build up your scenes and make them come to life with interactive behaviors and visual effects.

By combining the powerful 3D modeling and animation tools of 3ds Max with these new tools for authoring interactive experiences, 3ds Max Interactive aims to give you simple, efficient, and familiar workflows for creating engaging content.

As you get to know the interactive engine and editing tools, you'll occasionally see the name Stingray come up here and there. That's because 3ds Max Interactive is based on Autodesk's Stingray tech, the same tech that our customers are using to power a variety of [award-winning games](http://arrowheadgamestudios.com/games/helldivers/), [virtual-reality experiences](https://vimeo.com/219007622), [architectural visualizations](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit-live/overview), and more.

With 3ds Max Interactive, you'll get all the power and flexibility of Stingray, plus smoother interop with 3ds Max and Revit Live, and extra features designed specifically for 3ds Max users.
