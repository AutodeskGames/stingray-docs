# Adding Content to the Live Template

The default level in the Live template is called "empty.level"
, which can be found in the "content/levels" folder. Any new content you wish to bring in should be added to this level. 
Alternatively, you can change the default level (See the additional topics section).
You can import content for Live in the same way as any other 3dsMax Interactive project, through the FBX format for 3D models or any other supported format. For more information on this topic, see the ~{ Importing Assets }~ page.
Once you have imported you content into the project, you are ready to add it to the empty level.
