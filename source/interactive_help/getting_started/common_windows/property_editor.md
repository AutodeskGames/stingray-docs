# Property Editor

This panel is the main location where you can edit the properties of objects selected in the **Asset Browser** or **Explorer**.

You can select multiple objects in the **Explorer** panel to view and edit multiple shared attributes at the same time in the **Property Editor**.

If the selected objects already share the same value for a property, the value displays in the **Property Editor** as usual. If their values differ, a dash displays.
