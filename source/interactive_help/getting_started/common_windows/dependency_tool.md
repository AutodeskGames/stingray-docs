# Dependency tool

- **Window > Dependency**

Use the **Dependency** tool to find which assets are used in a level, which are not used, to check file dependencies, and to easily replace files.

When you select an asset, the **Dependency** tool shows you:

-  The assets that your selection refers to, in the **Uses** list.
-  The assets that refer to your selection, in the **Used by** list.
