# Project Manager

The **Project Manager** launches automatically each time you start the interactive editor. You can also select **File > Project Manager** to open the **Project Manager**.

You can use this window to create and manage your projects, and to download online example projects.

The first task you'll complete in {{ProductName}} is to create a project that organizes all the resources that make up your interactive application. Typically, you'll start each new project from one of the template projects available in the **Project Manager**, or from another existing project. This ensures you always have at least the minimal set of required resources in place when you get started.

You can also customize the **Project Manager** to change the labels or customize the project browser view when there are no projects, hide the search field and so on. To customize, modify the *.stingray_plugin* file of the project manager found under the `editor/plugins` folder in your {{ProductName}} installation. See ~{ Example Plug-ins }~ to learn more about extending the interactive plug-ins.
