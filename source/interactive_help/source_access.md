# Introduction to Source Code Access

This documentation is for developers working with the source code distribution of the interactive engine and editing tools. It tells you how to get the source code, and how to rebuild the engine and editing tools from scratch.

## Why get source access?

You don't need source code to work with {{ProductName}}. The installer for the regular binary distribution contains all the tools that you need in order to create unique, top-of-the-line immersive and interactive experiences for games and visualizations.

You also don't need source code access in order to customize and extend {{ProductName}}, because the editor and runtime engine offer a rich set of plug-in APIs. You can use these interfaces to create plug-ins that set up your own workflows, create and manage new kinds of data in your project, interact with third-party code or libraries, embed {{ProductName}} more efficiently into your production pipeline, etc. For details on these plug-in APIs, see the pages under ~{ The Interactive Plug-in SDK }~.

With all that said, there are some reasons why you might want to have access to the full source code anyway:

-	If you want to change something fundamental about the way the engine or editor works internally, and you can't accomplish what you need using the plug-in APIs.

-	If you want the very latest new developments and bug fixes from Autodesk the second we check them in to our source control.

-	If you want the possibility to debug the engine code as your project is running.

-	If you want to be able to fix bugs in the software on your own without waiting for the next release of the product. Even though we try to release new binary updates pretty frequently with tons of fixes, you might see source access as a safety net just in case you happen to discover a problem at a crucial point in your project's schedule.

-	If you want to contribute your own bug fixes and enhancements back to the community!

-	If you want your engine plug-ins to work on non-Windows platforms. The kind of plug-ins you can write with the SDK (currently) only work on Windows.

## How do I get source access?

Follow all the instructions on the ~{ Getting started with source access }~ page. They will walk you through the process of getting access to the code and setting up your repository.

## Are there extra fees for source access?

Maybe, it depends.

When you apply for source access for a new project, we will get in touch with you and have a conversation to sort it all out. So if you love {{ProductName}} and want to get more deeply involved, don't be shy to request source access.
