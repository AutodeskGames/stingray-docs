# Using HumanIK through Flow or Lua

Visually programming HumanIK with Flow is the easiest way to use HumanIK. In the HumanIK sample project, everything is demonstrated using Flow.

All HumanIK Flow nodes are grouped together in the Flow menu (right-click in the Flow Editor), and you can check out the sample project to start experimenting. You can also refer to 'HumanIK' in the [Flow Node Reference](../../../flow_ref/index.html) to browse the node descriptions.

# Using HumanIK through Lua

Using HumanIK through Lua offers all the same functionality as HumanIK through Flow, but with some additional freedom and a few more functions.

Refer to the 'HumanIK' category in the [Lua API Reference](../../../lua_ref/index.html), as well as the HumanIK Lua samples. (Under the 'Samples' category in the Lua reference.)
