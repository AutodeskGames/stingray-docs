# HumanIK

{{ProductName}} ships with HumanIK animation middleware, a full-body inverse kinematics (IK) solver and retargeter that lets you create believable character animations. The complete HumanIK middleware documentation is available [here](http://www.autodesk.com/humanik-sdkdoc-2016-enu).

Topics in this section provide information on HumanIK as it is integrated in {{ProductName}}.

>	**NOTE:** To take advantage of HumanIK features in {{ProductName}}, each character must be set up with a valid HumanIK skeleton definition. See ~{ HumanIK character setup }~.
