# Connect 3ds Max and 3ds Max Interactive Viewports

Connecting the viewports allows you to navigate your scene in both 3ds Max and 3ds Max Interactive simultaneously.

## Procedure

To connect viewports:

1.  Send your assets from 3ds Max to 3ds Max Interactive, and then place them in the viewport.
2.  In 3ds Max, click **Interactive > Live Camera Tracking**.
3.  Navigate through the scene.

As you adjust your view (move the camera) in one viewport, the other viewport also updates.

>	**Tip:** If you make any changes to assets, click **Interactive > Update** to refresh the other viewport.
