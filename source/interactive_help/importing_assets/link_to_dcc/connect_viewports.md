## Connect DCC tool and engine viewports

With the {{ProductName}} DCC link plug-in installed and loaded for your DCC tool, you can establish a live viewport connection between your DCC tool and the interactive editor.

>	**Note:** To see assets you're working on in the interactive editor inside a scene in your DCC tool, you must also send the objects to the DCC. See ~{ Send assets to a DCC tool}~.

In your DCC tool (Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max), enable **Live Camera Tracking** in the **Stingray** menu.

While **Live Camera Tracking** is enabled, the viewport in each linked application also controls the viewport in the other. For example, when you move the camera in the interactive editor viewport, you also move the camera in the DCC viewport. When you move the camera in your DCC viewport, you also move the camera in the interactive editor viewport.
