# Level Sync with Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max

You can link and export entire scenes built in Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max directly to {{ProductName}}. Once your DCC tool is linked to the interactive editor, scene assets can be automatically or manually tagged, and then reproduced with the same layout in your {{ProductName}} level. Modifications you make to the assets in your DCC tool are then updated inside the {{ProductName}} editor. This makes it easier to build, iterate, review and change scenes, without having to manually reproduce layouts in two tools.
