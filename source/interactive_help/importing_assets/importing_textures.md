# Import textures

> **Note:** Materials and textures can be included when importing a FBX file. See also ~{ Import a model with textures and materials }~.

For more information on supported file types, see ~{ Supported file formats }~.

**To import texture files independently:**

1.	In the ~{ Asset Browser }~, browse to the location where you want to import texture files.

2.	Click **Import**, browse to select one or more image files, and click **Open**. The editor brings the selected image files into the project, and creates a new *.texture* resource for each.

	By default, the editor assigns an appropriate texture template and appropriate compression settings for different target platforms as you import the textures. It can choose which type of texture compression to apply either by looking at the file name of the texture file, or by analyzing the image data. You can also modify the **Project Settings** to control the texture template assignment during import. See ~{ Edit project settings }~.

3. To set up additional properties for a new texture, double-click it in the **Asset Browser** to open it in the ~{ Texture Manager }~.
