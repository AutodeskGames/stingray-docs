## Installing 3ds Max Interactive

Installing 3ds Max Interactive follows the same process as installing Stingray. For more information, including some basic troubleshooting tips, refer to the [Stingray Installation Supplement](http://www.autodesk.com/stingray-install-enu).

>	**Important:**  If you have a previously installed version of Autodesk Stingray (including Stingray 1.8 or any newer beta version of Stingray), you'll need to manually uninstall the DCC Link plugin before installing 3ds Max Interactive. Otherwise, our installer mistakenly detects that you have a newer version of the plugin and won't install the latest. You need the right version of this plugin to use the interop features that link 3ds Max with Max Interactive. After you uninstall your existing version of the plugin (using Windows Control Panel), the correct DCC Link plugin installs correctly when you install 3ds Max Interactive.
