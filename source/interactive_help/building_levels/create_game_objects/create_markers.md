#Create markers

Markers are used for locating a position in your level so you can make actions happen at that location. For example, you can spawn a unit at a given marker.

1.	Do either of the following:

	-	From the main menu bar, select **Create > Marker**.
	-	Open the **Create** window (**Window > Create**), select the **Helpers** tab, then select **Marker** from the **Misc** category.

2.	In the **Level Viewport**, click to place a marker.

	An 'M' icon displays with the cursor to indicate the marker creation mode.

After creating the marker, you can select markers in the **Explorer** panel, and modify properties in the **Property Editor**.
