# Select objects in a level

The Select tool ![](../images/icon_select.png) lets you select multiple objects to manipulate and control them as a single object. The Select tool has two modes of selection, **Window** or **Crossing**.

While the **Window** mode selects only objects within in a marquee selection, the **Crossing** mode selects all objects in a marquee selection and any objects that intersect the selection.

1. Click the **Select** tool in the ~{ Toolbar }~.
2. Do either of the following for selection mode:

    - Right-click the Select tool and select one of the modes.
    - Click the Select tool to switch to **Window** mode ![](../images/select_window.png) or **Crossing** mode ![](../images/select_cross.png).
3. Marquee select the objects.  During the selection, the objects are highlighted with a white outline and the last selected object is highlighted with a green outline. This object is used when you transform the selected objects, for example when you move or rotate the selection.

To add more objects to the selected objects, Shift-click or Shift-marquee select and to remove objects, Ctrl+ Shift-click or Ctrl + Shift-marquee select. For more information, see ~{ Hotkeys }~.

>**Important:** To optimize performance, it is recommended that you select a maximum of 1024 objects at one time.
