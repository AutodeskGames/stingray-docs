# Show or hide the grid, objects, or gizmos

Toggling the visibility of the grid, level objects, and gizmos unclutters the **Level Viewport**, letting you easily layout your level.


**To show or hide the grid**

-	In the menu bar, select **Edit**, then enable or disable **Grid** (Hotkey: G).

The grid is displayed/hidden in all view panels.

**To show or hide objects**

Do any of the following:

- Select an object(s) in the **Level Viewport** or the **Explorer** panel, then select **Edit > Object Visibility > Hide\Unhide Selected** (Hotkey: H).
- In the menu bar, select **Edit > Object Visibility > Hide Unselected** (Hotkey: Alt + H) .
- In the menu bar, select **Edit > Object Visibility > Unhide All** (Hotkey: Ctrl + Alt + H).

The object(s) is displayed/hidden in all view panels, and its visibility icon turns blue in the **Explorer** panel.

**To show or hide gizmos**

Gizmos are objects and manipulators that show up in the editor's viewport to help you build your levels, but that aren't visible when you run your project in the engine. For example, light sources, reflection probes, triggers, and cameras are all visible when you're working on a level, but aren't displayed when you test your level or run your project.

-  In the menu bar, select **Edit**, then enable or disable **Gizmos**.

The gizmos are displayed/hidden in all view panels.

**To show or hide gizmos per view panel**

-	Click the **View** HUD in the **Level** viewport, then enable or disable **Gizmos** and/or **Grid**.

When a gizmo is hidden using the **View** HUD, its visibility icon turns orange in the **Explorer** panel, indicating it is only hidden in the currently selected view panel.
