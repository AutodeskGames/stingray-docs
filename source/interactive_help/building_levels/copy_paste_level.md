# Copy and paste objects in a level

Add common objects throughout your project by copy and pasting level objects in the current level or to other levels.

>Tip: You can also paste level objects to a text editor to view its json data.

**To cut/copy objects:**

1. Select the object or multiple objects either in the **Level Viewport** or in the tree view of the **Explorer** panel.
2. Copy the objects using any of the following methods:

	-	Right-click in the **Explorer** panel and select **Cut** or **Copy**.
	-	Right-click the selected object in the **Level Viewport** and select **Cut** or **Copy** from the contextual menu.
	-	Select objects in the **Level Viewport** or **Explorer** and in the **Edit** menu, select **Cut** (Hotkey: Ctrl + X) or **Copy** (Hotkey: Ctrl + C).

**To paste objects in the current level:**

1. Right-click either in the **Level Viewport** or the **Explorer** panel to select **Paste** or select **Edit > Paste** (Hotkey: Ctrl + V) to paste the objects in the viewport. Objects are pasted at the same position and rotation of the copied objects.

	>Note: Objects are pasted around the cursor position if there is a raycast hit on objects. This works only if pasting from the **Level Viewport** contextual menu or with hotkey Ctrl + V, and does not work from the **Explorer** panel.

 **To paste objects in another level:**

1. Save any changes in the current level, then copy the objects that you want to paste.
2. Open the level (Ctrl + O) where you want to paste the level objects.
3. Right-click either in the **Level Viewport** or the **Explorer** panel to select **Paste**, or press **Ctrl + V**. The objects are pasted in the same position as the objects copied from the other level.
