# Select, hide, or freeze level objects in layers

**To select objects in a layer**

1. In the **Explorer** panel, open the **Layers** view (Hotkey: L).

2. Right-click a layer name and select **Select Objects in Layer**.

	The objects are selected in the **Layers** view and the **Level Viewport**.

	>**Tip:** Double-click a layer in the **Explorer** to focus and frame the objects in the **Viewport**.

**To hide or freeze objects in a layer**


1. In the **Layers** view, select a layer and do the following:

	- Click ![](../../images/icon_hide_layers.png) to hide/unhide the selected layer (Hokey: H).

	When a layer is hidden, its objects are invisible in the **Level Viewport**.


	- Click ![](../../images/icon_freeze_layers.png) to freeze/unfreeze the selected layer.

	Freezing a layer locks its objects, so they cannot be modified.
