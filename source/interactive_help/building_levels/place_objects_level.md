# Place objects in a level

**To place an object within a level**


1. Do either of the following in the ~{ Asset Browser }~ to find and select the object unit file:

	- Navigate directly to the `Content` folder of your project and select a file.

	- Search for the object file name using the **Asset Browser** Search field.

2. Do either of the following to place an instance of the object in the level:

 	- Drag the object file from the **Asset Browser** into the **Level Editor**.

 	- Select the **Place Tool** ![](../images/icon_PlaceTool.png) in the main ~{ Toolbar }~, then click to place the object.

As you hover in the level when dragging the object file, or with the Placement tool active, a wireframe version of the unit displays with your cursor, letting you preview how the object will appear.

**Tips:**

- To view the asset before you place it, open the ~{ Asset Preview }~ window (**Window > Asset Preview** if it's not already displayed).

- Shift + drag after you place a unit to continue placing more of the same.
