# Getting Started

Once you've downloaded and installed Stingray, you can select **Autodesk > Stingray** from the Windows **Start** menu to launch the application. You'll need to log in with your Autodesk ID when you run Stingray.

What's next? Well, you can browse more topics in this Getting started section like the ~{ Interface overview }~, watch some [video tutorials](../tutorial_link/tutorials_on_area.html), or jump right in.

You'll start up in the Stingray *editor*. This is the main tool that you'll be using to build your content. The editor helps you do things like:

-	bring in 3D content like models, animations and textures from other applications like Maya or 3ds Max,
-	lay out your content in scenes, which we call *levels*,
-	set up the way end-users will interact with your scenes and content,
-	create other kinds of content specific to Stingray, like particle effects,
-	and *deploy* your content in a standalone package or app for one or more target platforms like Windows, iOS, or Android.

But the first thing you'll need to do is create and open a *project*. The project contains all the different kinds of files and assets that you'll use to create your interactive app -- 3D models, materials and textures, levels, Lua files, and more. Stingray comes with some standard template projects you can use as a starting point, or you can download a sample project from the **Online Examples** tab of the ~{ Project Manager }~.

See the pages under ~{ Set up a project }~ for more on what projects are and how to work with them.

Your project will open up in the Stingray editor, but that's not the way people will ultimately experience your project when you distribute it. So, one of the first things you'll want to do with your new project is test it out to see how it behaves in the runtime Stingray game engine. Don't miss ~{ Test and build a project }~ for an introduction to running your content.
