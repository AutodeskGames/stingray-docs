# Edit or rename an entity

As with most other kinds of objects you work with in the interactive editor, you edit properties for your entities in the ~{ Property Editor }~ panel.

However, entities can be defined in two different places: inside their own *.entity* resource files, or inside levels. It is important to make sure that you select the entity definition that you want to edit in the right place:

-	If you want to modify the components or properties for an entity *asset*, find and select the *.entity* resource file you want to modify in the ~{ Asset Browser }~.

-	If you want to modify the components or properties for an entity within a level, open the level, then find and select the entity in the ~{ Explorer panel }~.

## Renaming an entity

Unlike other kinds of objects that are placeable in a level, you cannot modify the name of an entity within a level directly within the **Property Editor**.

To rename an entity definition in a level:

-	Right-click the entity in the **Explorer** panel, and choose **Rename** from the contextual menu.
