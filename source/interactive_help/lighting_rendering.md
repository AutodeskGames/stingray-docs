# Lighting and Rendering

The topics in this section cover everything involved in developing the way your game *looks* to the player. This involves three main jobs:

-	Setting up the *lighting* -- i.e. the various ways that light gets emitted into your scene. See the ~{ Lighting }~ section.

-	*Shading* the objects in your scene, which you do by assigning them *materials* that determine the way their surfaces react to incoming light. See the ~{ Shading }~ section.

-	Setting up the *shading environment*, which offers global rendering settings and optional post-processing effects. See ~{ The Shading environment and post effects }~ section.

The light bouncing around in the level, the surface materials of the objects in the scene, and the global rendering settings all interact to produce the final rendered images in the game's viewport.

For a small scene that demonstrates the rendering quality possible with Stingray, why not come over and hang out in our pool room for a while? Open the Poolroom example from the **Online Projects** tab of the **Project Manager**, or [download the project here](https://gamedev.autodesk.com/stingray/plugins/arcviz_poolroom_example)!
