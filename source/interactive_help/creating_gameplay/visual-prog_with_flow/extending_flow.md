# Extending Flow

You can extend the set of Flow nodes that comes built in to {{ProductName}} by creating your own custom nodes that call Lua functions you provide in a *.lua* script file in your project. Your custom Flow nodes are treated exactly like the built-in Flow nodes: they show up in the Flow editors, and they can be connected to other Flow nodes as usual.

For details on defining your custom Flow nodes, see ~{ Create custom Flow nodes in Lua }~.
