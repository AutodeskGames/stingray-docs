# Gameware Navigation

Autodesk Gameware Navigation is a middleware for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 3D video games and simulations: it helps your computer-controlled characters (NPCs) find and follow paths from place to place in the 3D world, avoiding collisions with each other and with other dynamic obstacles; and it provides spatial analysis tools for getting information about the 3D world.

The Gameware Navigation plug-in adds the following capabilities to {{ProductName}}:

*	You can automatically create navigation meshes for your levels in the interactive editor.
*	You can spawn bots in the engine at runtime, and make them find and follow paths from place to place in the level.
*	In your Lua or Flow code, you can conduct high-performance spatial queries against the navigation data, and use the results to drive gameplay.

The best way to learn about Navigation in {{ProductName}} is to get your hands on the example projects for Flow and Lua. Open them from the **Online Projects** tab of the **Project Manager**, or [download the projects here](http://www.autodesk.com/stingray-online-projects)!
