# After You Release

With {{ProductName}}, you can create a standalone interactive application on your choice of platforms, which you can distribute through private channels or through paid stores to the general public. Once you have released your app into the wild, you might think your job is over -- time to sit back and watch the brilliant experience you've created go viral. But before you start counting royalty checks, you have a few more things to think about.

Having customers using your app means people to support, and that means more problems to diagnose. How do you figure out what went wrong? How do you fix the problems and get updates into the hands of your customers as quickly as possible? And how can you keep building on your project's success by releasing more new content?

The topics in this section describe the role of the interative engine and editing tools in all of these post-release considerations.
