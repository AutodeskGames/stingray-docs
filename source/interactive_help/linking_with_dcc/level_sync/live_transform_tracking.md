# Sync transform controls between 3ds Max and 3ds Max Interactive

![NEW](../../images/new.png)

Live Transform Tracking mode (**Interactive > Live Transform Tracking**) lets you sync your transform controls across applications after you connect the 3ds Max and 3ds Max Interactive viewports.

>**Tip:** You can combine VR level editing with **Live Transform Tracking** mode in 3ds Max in order to edit your Max scene live in VR! Just do a level sync from 3ds Max and activate the live transform mode before you switch to 3ds Max Interactive and start editing your level in VR. For details, see ~{ Edit a level in VR }~.

To sync transform controls:

1. ~{ Send assets from 3ds Max with Level Sync }~.
2. In 3ds Max, select **Interactive > Live Transform Tracking** to sync the transform controls.
  Once this option is on, you can perform the following actions:
  - Move, rotate, or scale objects

	Transforming an object in one application also transforms the object in the other application

  - Create project instances

	Any instanced objects created in one application appear in the other application.

  - Delete objects

 	>**Note:** In 3ds Max Interactive, you can only undo delete actions for instanced units. However, for best results, it is recommended that you do not undo delete actions in Live Transform mode.
