# Send assets from Maya and Maya LT with Level Sync

Level sync lets you link and export entire scenes built in Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max directly to {{ProductName}}. Once Maya or Maya LT are linked to the interactive editor, scene assets can be automatically or manually tagged, and then reproduced with the same layout in your {{ProductName}} level.

> **Note:** Currently, level sync only supports scenes from Maya and Maya LT that use the Y-up world coordinate system.
