# Receive assets from 3ds Max

To send assets to {{ProductName}}:

1.  Open {{ProductName}} and load the project where you plan to use the assets.
2.  Establish a connection with 3ds Max. See ~{ Send assets to 3ds Max }~.
3.  With your model selected in 3ds Max, select **Interactive > Send All** to export all assets in the scene, or **Interactive > Send Selection** to export only selected assets.
4.  In the file browser that appears, navigate to where you want to save the FBX file within your interactive project, enter a new filename if needed, and click **Save**.
5. In the **Import FBX** options window that appears, set options to import your asset with textures and materials. See ~{ Import a model with textures and materials }~.
6. Click **Import**.

    The assets export to your interactive project, into the specified directory. The FBX file is available immediately in the **Asset Browser**, and you can place the imported assets into your level. Any materials associated with the imported objects are created as separate files alongside the asset in the project folder.

7. If you continue to work on the assets in 3ds Max, select **Interactive > Update** at any time to refresh the assets in {{ProductName}}.
