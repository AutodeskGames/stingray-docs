# Connect 3ds Max and {{ProductName}} viewports

Once you send assets from Max Interactive to 3ds Max, you can also establish a live viewport connection between 3ds Max and the Interactive editor. This gives you a synchronized view as you navigate your scene simultaneously in both viewports.

To connect viewports:

1. Send your assets from 3ds Max to {{ProductName}}, and then place them in the viewport.
2. In 3ds Max, enable **Interactive > Live Camera Tracking**.
3. Navigate through the scene.

    While **Live Camera Tracking** is enabled, the viewport in each linked application also controls the viewport in the other. For example, when you move the camera in the Interactive editor viewport, you also move the camera in the 3ds Max viewport. When you move the camera in 3ds Max, you also move the camera in the Interactive editor viewport.

   >	**Tip:** If you make any changes to assets, click **Interactive > Update** to refresh the other viewport.
