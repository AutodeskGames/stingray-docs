# Getting started with source access

The topics in this section will get you up and running with the source code:

1.	You'll need to ~{ Register as a developer }~. This involves creating some (free) user accounts and requesting source access from Autodesk.

3.	Once you are granted access to the code on GitHub, you'll have to decide on a ~{ Source code management }~ strategy for your organization. This section provides some information about the Autodesk repositories, and suggestions for how to work with them.

3.	Install all the base software requirements for Windows development, plus any additional requirements for other platforms that you want your project to run on. For the most up-to-date list of software you'll need, see the `readme.md` file at the root of the source repository.

	Note that these requirements change occasionally, and may be slightly different across different branches of the repository. For example, if you switch from `release` to `develop`, you may find that you need to update a third-party component or library.

4.	Once you have a revision of the source code residing on your local computer, you need to understand how to get the ~{ Library dependencies }~ you need in order to rebuild the editor and engine binaries from the source code.

After you have completed these steps, you should be ready to start ~{ Building from source }~ and developing with the source code.
