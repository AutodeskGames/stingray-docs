# Rebuilding in Visual Studio

Once you have run the `make.rb` script at least once, you can rebuild the solutions for the editing tools and runtime engine in Visual Studio. Recompiling the solutions from within Visual Studio will produce the same results as re-running the `make.rb` build script.

> **Note:** Please always use the Visual Studio projects generated by the CMake system. Custom configurations might cause compile and linking errors.

1.	Open one of the following solutions in Visual Studio:

	-	`build\engine\<platform>\{{SR_DOC_EXE_PREFIX}}_engine_<platform>.sln`: The runtime interactive engine.
	-	`build\editor\<platform>\{{SR_DOC_EXE_PREFIX}}_editor_<platform>.sln`: The front-end user interface for the editor application. See the next section for additional details.
	-	`editor\backend\{{SR_DOC_EXE_PREFIX}}_editor_backend.sln`: The back-end of the editor.
	-	`tools\all_tools\all_tools.sln`: Legacy editing tools.

2.	Set the desired build configuration: Debug, Dev or Release. See also ~{ About engine build configurations }~.

3.	Build the solution.

## Known Issues

If you configure the Visual Studio solution for the engine with a global path to the DirectX SDK, the `scaleformstudio_plugin` project in the Debug configuration will fail to link with the following error:
