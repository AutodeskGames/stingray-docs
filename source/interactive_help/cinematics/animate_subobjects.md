# Animate sub-objects with the Story Editor #

Sub-object mode lets you select and animate objects within a unit's hierarchy.

1. Select the unit you want to animate.

2. In the **Story Editor**, click ![](../images/icon_storyEd_addNew.png).

	This adds a new story and a new unit track in the tree view area.

3. In the tree view, right-click the unit track and select **Add Sub Object > Object Name**.

	A new sub-object track is added.

	> **Note:** Picking a track auto-selects the appropriate node.

4. In the ~{ Toolbar }~, click ![](../images/icon_subObjectmode.png) to turn on sub-object mode.

 	In sub-object mode, you can select any of the unit's nodes.

	> **Note:** Sub-object mode persists when switching between instances of one unit.

5. Scrub to the frame or time you want in the **Story Editor** timeline, manipulate the sub-object in the **Level Viewport**, then press S or click ![](../images/icon_storyEd_addkey.png) to set a keyframe.
