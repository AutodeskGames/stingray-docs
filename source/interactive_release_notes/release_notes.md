#Release Notes

Thank you for downloading Autodesk Stingray.

The release notes documents for each version of Stingray (linked below) describe what's new, what's fixed, known limitations and workarounds, plus other important information about each release. We strongly recommend that you read the appropriate release notes document before you install and run any version of the program.

Notes in this topic are general, and apply to all releases of Stingray.

##Data collection and use

As of Stingray 1.2.5, a new Autodesk analytics program replaces the Customer Involvement Program (CIP).

When you first launch Stingray, the **Data collection and use** dialog box appears with information about our data collection policy. You can also find those policies here: [About Desktop Analytics](http://www.autodesk.com/company/legal-notices-trademarks/privacy-statement/about-desktop-analytics-english). Desktop analytics collection is on by default.

If you decide to opt out later, you can turn off the participation check box using the **Help** menu in Stingray. Select **Help > Speak Back > Desktop Analytics Program**, then turn off the "I agree" option and click Ok.

##Customer Error Reports (CERs)

We can improve the stability of our products largely because of the Customer Error Reports (CERs) that people submit. We thank you for taking the time to fill out these reports and ask that you include as much information as possible about what actions you were performing at the time the error occurred. These details raise the value of the report immensely and are very much appreciated by the Autodesk Stingray Engineering team.

For further information about CERs refer to http://www.autodesk.com/cer.
