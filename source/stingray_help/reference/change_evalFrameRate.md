#Change the default evaluation frame rate

You can change the default frame rate used in all Stingray tools or editors that have a viewport, including the **Level Viewport**, **Asset Preview**, and so on. This can be particularly useful when you want to preview how your game will look on systems that use different fps settings.

By default, all Stingray viewport panels display your level at 60 fps, which you'll likely use for example if your target platform is PS4 or Xbox One.

**To change the default frame rate:**

1. From the main menu bar, select **File > Settings > Editor Settings**.

	The Editor Settings display in the ~{ Property Editor }~.

2. Adjust the **Viewport max framerate** value to set the frame rate you want.
