It's a modern game engine built on a powerful, data-driven core architecture that can produce visually stunning games and scale to large projects. See ~{ What is Stingray? }~ for more.

##Who is Stingray for?

It's designed for pro-indie game makers in small to medium game studios looking for an open and flexible 3D game engine.

##What is the difference between Stingray and the Bitsquid game engine? <a name="stingray-bitsquid"></a>

Stingray is a new game engine based on the core technology of the Bitsquid game engine that Autodesk purchased in 2014. Many of the core benefits of the Bitsquid game engine such as its lightweight, data-driven base have been integrated into Stingray. Other aspects of Stingray including much of the UI, the new physically-based renderer, and the interoperability with Autodesk 3D animation software are new.

##Is Stingray compatible with 3D assets created in non-Autodesk 3D animation tools? <a name="stingray-compatibility"></a>

Yes. Stingray can accept assets from any 3D animation software that supports exporting of assets in the Autodesk® FBX® asset exchange format. However, for the most efficient workflows with the Stingray engine artists and game makers should use Autodesk 3D animation software. To learn more about the FBX format, visit the FBX product page at [www.autodesk.com/fbx](http://www.autodesk.com/fbx).
