# Getting Started

Once you've downloaded and installed Stingray, you can select Autodesk > Stingray from the  Start menu to launch the application. You'll need to log in with your Autodesk ID when you run Stingray.

What's next? Well, should you choose to accept it, we recommend you select **Help > Hands-on Training Mission**. This launches the first in a series of interactive onboarding tutorials designed to get you up and running fast with Stingray.

You can also browse more topics in this Getting started section, watch some [video tutorials](../tutorial_link/tutorials_on_area.html), or jump right in. The first thing you'll need to do is create a project to contain all the files you'll use to build a game. See ~{ Set up a project }~.
