# Getting Started

Once you've downloaded and installed Stingray, you can select Autodesk Stingray Editor from the  Start menu to launch the application. You'll need to log in with your Autodesk ID when you run Stingray.

What's next? You can browse more topics in this Getting started section, watch some video tutorials, or jump right in. The first thing you'll need to do is create a project to contain all the files you'll use to build a game. See ~{ Set up a project }~.
