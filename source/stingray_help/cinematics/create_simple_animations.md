#Create simple animations with the **Story Editor**

1. Select the unit (or units) you want to animate and click ![](../images/icon_storyEd_addNew.png) in the ~{ Story Editor }~. Click *Yes* when prompted on whether you want to add the units to a story.

	This adds a new story and a new unit track in the tree view area.

	By default, the unit track lets you access the object's transform properties for animation. Right-click to select and add more properties to the unit track, including material properties.

2. Click ![](../images/icon_storyEd_LIVE.png) to enable editing for the unit.

	  > **Note:** You can also select, move, delete, or modify key values when the **Story Editor** is not Live.

3. Scrub to the frame or time you want in the **Story Editor** timeline, manipulate the object in the **Level Viewport**, then press S or click  ![](../images/icon_storyEd_addkey.png) to set a keyframe.

	> **Note:** As you animate units in the **Story Editor**, the animation plays back only in the **Level Viewport**, it cannot playback on connected devices.

4. Once you've set a few keyframes, use the playback controls in the **Story Editor** to watch your animation playback in the **Level Viewport**.

5. Edit keys as needed, using either the curve editing view, or the key editing view. (Click ![](../images/icon_storyEd_wrench.png) to switch between view panels.)

	> **Note:** When animating a property of a unit or entity, editing values in the **Property Editor** has no effect on keys in the **Story Editor**. When animating a unit transform (position, rotation, scale), you can use the **Property Editor** to edit animation values.


When you're finished editing animation for the unit, click ![](../images/icon_storyEd_LIVE.png) again to disable the **Story Editor** and go back to editing your level.
