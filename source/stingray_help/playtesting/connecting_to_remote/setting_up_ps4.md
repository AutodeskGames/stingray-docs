# Setting up remote connections for PlayStation 4

To connect the Stingray Engine to a PlayStation 4:

1.	Make sure you have followed all the steps under ~{ Requirements for PlayStation 4 game development }~ in order to prepare your development environment.

2.	In the Stingray Editor, use the **Connections** panel to set up a connection to the PlayStation 4 device, then mirror the Editor viewport or run your project.

	For details, see ~{ Using the Connections panel }~.

When you connect the Stingray Editor to the device, the Stingray Editor automatically installs the engine on the device over the USB connection, runs the engine on the device, then sends your project data to the engine.
