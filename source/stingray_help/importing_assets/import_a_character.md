# Import a character mesh

1. Open or create a project. See also ~{ Set up a project }~.

2. In the **Asset Browser**, create a new folder for your character mesh in the content/models folder.
	Example: *content/models/new_character*.

3. Click **Import**, then navigate to select the character mesh FBX file. See also ~{ Import an FBX file }~.

4. (Optional) If your FBX file also contains the character's animation clips, turn on **Animation** in the **Import FBX** options to import animation at the same time. See also ~{ Import animation clips }~.

	With Animation enabled in the Import FBX options, additional settings become available.

5. If you're also importing animation, select **New or update skeleton** in **Skeleton** and enter a name for the skeleton of your character mesh.
	This makes it easy to apply animation clips later on.
