# Import textures

> **Note:** Materials and textures can be included when importing a FBX file. See also ~{ Import a model with textures and materials }~.

For more information on supported file types, see ~{ Supported file formats }~.

**To import texture files independently:**

1.	In the **Asset Browser**, browse to the location where you want to import texture files.

2.	Click **Import**, browse to select one or more image files, and click **Open**. Stingray will bring the selected image files into the project, and create a new *.texture* resource for each.

    By default, Stingray assigns an appropriate texture template and compression settings for different target platforms as you import the textures. Stingray can apply the texture compression either by texture file suffix comparison or by image analysis. You can also modify the **Project Settings** to control the texture template assignment during import. See ~{ Edit project settings }~.

3. To set up additional properties for a new texture, double-click it in the Asset Browser to open it in the ~{ Texture Manager }~.
