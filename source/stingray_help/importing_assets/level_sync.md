# Level Sync with Maya and Maya LT

You can link and export entire scenes built in Maya or Maya LT directly to Stingray. Once Maya or Maya LT are linked to the Stingray editor, scene assets can be automatically or manually tagged, and then reproduced with the same layout in Stingray. Modifications you make to the assets in Maya or Maya LT are then updated inside Stingray. This makes it way easier to build, iterate, review and change scenes, without having to manually reproduce layouts in two tools.
