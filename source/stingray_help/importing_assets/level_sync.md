# Level Sync with Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max

![UPDATED](../images/updated.png)

You can link and export entire scenes built in Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max directly to Stingray. Once your DCC is linked to the Stingray editor, scene assets can be automatically or manually tagged, and then reproduced with the same layout in Stingray. Modifications you make to the assets in your DCC are then updated inside Stingray. This makes it easier to build, iterate, review and change scenes, without having to manually reproduce layouts in two tools.
