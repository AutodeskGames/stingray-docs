# Import and test LODs using FBX

For information on setting up LODs in your FBX file, refer to the documentation in your content creation package. (For example, in Maya LT, look for a topic called 'Create an LOD group'.)

## Import LODs

1. Import an FBX file containing your LOD geometry.
	See also ~{ Import an FBX file }~.
	**Level of Details** is on by default in the **Import FBX** options.

2. In the **Asset Browser**, double-click the imported unit to open it in the ~{ Unit Editor }~.
	Your LODs and the associated geometry display in the tree view on the left side of the **Unit Editor**.

3. Switch to the **Level of Detail** panel (top right in the **Unit Editor**).
	Each Screen Height Percentage threshold displays, the same way you set them up in Maya or Maya LT.

## Test LODs in Stingray

1. Drag the unit from the **Asset Browser** into the **Level Viewport** to place it in your level.

2. Zoom in and out with the camera (scroll wheel or Alt + right-drag) to see the LOD geometry switching.


>	**Tip:** In the LOD panel in the **Unit Editor**, you can add levels, set the percentages, and  add objects to each level.
