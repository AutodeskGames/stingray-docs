#Interop with Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max

Interop with Stingray is supported as of Extension 1 for Maya 2016, Maya LT 2016, and 3ds Max 2016.

In order to establish a link between Stingray and your **DCC** (digital content creation) tool, there are a few configuration steps necessary:

1. ~{ Setup the DCC tool plug-in }~
3. ~{ Connect DCC tool and Stingray viewports}~
4. ~{ Send assets to a DCC tool }~

 Once you have pointed Stingray to your content creation tool, you can simply right-click an asset in the **Asset Browser**, and select **Send to** > *Product Name*, or select **Open Source Asset**.

> **Tip:** For more information in the Maya or Maya LT Help, look for the topic *Work with Stingray game engine*.

> **Note:** In the Stingray Help, we use the term **DCC** tool when we're referring to your content creation tool (such as Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max). (DCC = digital content creation).
