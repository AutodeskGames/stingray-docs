##Connect DCC tool and Stingray viewports

With the Stingray DCC link plug-in installed and loaded for your DCC tool, you can also establish a live viewport connection between your DCC tool and Stingray.

>	**Note:** To see assets you're working on in Stingray inside a scene in your DCC tool, you must also send the objects to the DCC. See ~{ Send assets to a DCC tool}~.

1. In your DCC tool (Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max), enable **Live Camera Tracking** in the **Stingray** menu.
<br>
With **Live Camera Tracking** enabled, the viewport in one linked application starts to control the viewport in the other. For example, when working in the Stingray viewport, it starts to control the DCC viewport. When working in your DCC viewport, it starts to control the Stingray viewport. As you adjust your view (your camera) in one viewport, the other viewport updates as well.
