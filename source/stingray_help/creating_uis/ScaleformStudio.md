# Scaleform Studio in Stingray

Autodesk Scaleform Studio is an editor and a runtime that enables you to create rich, interactive 2.5D user interfaces and graphics for use with Stingray.  Scaleform Studio supports bitmaps, text and vector graphics, so that users can create animated UI menu screens, in-game HUDs and other 2D graphics for use with Stingray.

The Scaleform Studio plug-in provides the following capabilities to Stingray:

* Import 2D content content directly into the Stingray engine for integrated menus and in-game HUDs.
* Import bitmap, vector graphics, fonts, and Lua script assets in a variety of formats to create animations and interactive 2D graphics.
* Create rich text and perform text manipulation, add filters using the text editing and color picking tool.
* Localize your game text using the data driven localization support and font mapping available in Scaleform Studio.
* Edit and debug scripts attached to objects using the Lua editor.
