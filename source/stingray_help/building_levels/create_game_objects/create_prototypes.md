# Create prototypes

Prototypes are simple cuboids with adjustable height, length, and width properties.  They let you  rapidly develop geometry in order to rough out level elements, until you have more permanent artwork ready. They are also useful for creating invisible physics actors.


1. Do either of the following:
	- From the main menu bar, select **Create > Prototype**.
	- In the **Create Window** (**Window > Create**), select  the **Objects** tab, then select **Prototype**.

2. In the **Level Viewport**, click to place the prototype, then drag to set the width and depth of your prototype geometry as follows:

	- Click and drag first to set the width of the base (then release).

	- Next, drag to set the height.

3. Click an empty area in the **Level Viewport** to commit.
