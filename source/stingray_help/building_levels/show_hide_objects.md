#Show or hide the grid, objects, or gizmos

Toggling the visibility of the grid, level objects, and gizmos unclutters the **Level Viewport**, letting you easily layout your level.


**To show or hide the grid**

1. In the menu bar, select **Edit**, then enable or disable **Grid** (Hotkey: G).
<br>
The grid is displayed/hidden in all view panels.

**To show or hide objects**

1. Do any of the following:



	- Select an object(s) in the **Level Viewport** or the **Explorer** panel, then select **Edit > Object Visibility > Hide\Unhide Selected** (Hotkey: H).
	- In the menu bar, select **Edit > Object Visibility > Hide Unselected** (Hotkey: Alt + H) .
	- In the menu bar, select **Edit > Object Visibility > Unhide All** (Hotkey: Ctrl + Alt + H).
<br>

	The object(s) is displayed/hidden in all view panels, and its visibility icon turns blue in the **Explorer** panel.

**To show or hide gizmos**
<br>
Gizmos are objects that assist in level building, but aren't visible in game play. For example, the geometry of lamps, triggers, and cameras are visible when creating a level, but aren't displayed in the game.
<br>

1.  In the menu bar, select **Edit**, then enable or disable **Gizmos**.
<br>
The gizmos are displayed/hidden in all view panels.

**To show or hide gizmos per view panel**

1. Click the **View** HUD in the **Level** viewport, then enable or disable **Gizmos** and/or **Grid**.
<br>
When a gizmo is hidden using the **View** HUD, its visibility icon turns orange in the **Explorer** panel, indicating it is only hidden in the currently selected view panel.
