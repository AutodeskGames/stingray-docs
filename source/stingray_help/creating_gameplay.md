# Creating Gameplay

With Stingray, you can set up interactive gameplay using Flow visual programming, and Lua scripting. Topics in this section introduce you to both.

>  A great way to get started with interactive authoring is to check out some real working game projects built in Stingray. These kits are built mostly in Flow, so they demonstrate the kind of things you can accomplish without needing to write a ton of custom code.
