# HumanIK sample project and common use cases

HumanIK can help you accomplish all common IK tasks you need in a game. Grabbing	an object on the ground, opening a door, aiming a weapon, looking at 	somebody.

> ![](../../images/icon_CreativeMarket.png) The best way to learn about HumanIK in Stingray is to get your hands on the 'HumanIK Example' project, available on <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/stingray-creativemarket-samples" target="blank">Creative Market.</a>

The sample project illustrates some of the most common use cases, including:

 - Floor Contact
 - Aiming
 - Looking At
 - Reaching
 - Finger IK

But there are many more! We recommend that you download the project and start to experiment with the sample project as you prepare to work with HumanIK on your own game.
