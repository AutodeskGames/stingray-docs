# Using HumanIK through Flow or Lua

Visually programming HumanIK with Flow is the easiest way to use HumanIK. In the HumanIK sample project available on [Creative Market](http://www.autodesk.com/stingray-creativemarket-samples), everything is demonstrated using Flow.

All HumanIK Flow nodes are grouped together in the Flow menu (right-click in the Flow Editor), and you can check out the sample project to start experimenting. You can also refer to 'HumanIK' in the [Stingray Flow Node Reference](../../../flow_ref/index.html) to browse the node descriptions.

# Using HumanIK through Lua

Using HumanIK through Lua offers all the same functionality as HumanIK through Flow, but with some additional freedom and a few more functions.

Refer to the 'HumanIK' category in the [Stingray Lua API Reference](../../../lua_ref/index.html), as well as the HumanIK Lua samples. (Under the 'Samples' category in the Lua reference.)
