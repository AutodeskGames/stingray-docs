## What's New

* * *

## Screen Space Reflection Ray Bending

Near the edges of the screen, you can now make screen space reflections rays bend instead of fade out.

## Refraction

Transparent materials can now refract the opaque objects behind them using the refraction input on the material.

<br>

## Temporal AA blur reduction

Improvements to temporal anti-aliasing now produces sharper results.

##Subsurface Scattering (translucency)

To simulate the look of sub-surface scattering, you can now make materials translucent using the Density input on the Material Variable node.

<br>

## Also new in Rendering

- Screen Space AO performance improvements and ghosting reduction

- Improved skydome workflows

	The skydome is now a regular Unit placed on a frozen layer named 'Background'. If you remove it, you can recreate it 	in the current layer by selecting ***Create > Skydome*** from the main menu bar.

- Support for V-Ray materials

	You can import texture maps from V-Ray materials with the following file name properties:

	-	texmap_diffuse
	-	texmap_self_illumination
	-	texmap_bump
	-	texmap_opacity


## Organize objects on layers

Organize groups of related level objects using the new **Layers** view (Hotkey: L) in the **Explorer** window. Layers let you quickly select, show, hide, or freeze groups of level objects all at once, helping you isolate the objects you want to work with. You can also filter your level objects by type to further unclutter levels that contain many objects. To get started in the **Layers** view, click ![](../images/add_new_layer.png), and then drag and drop objects between layers.

![](../images/readme_layers.png)

For new information, see ~{ Organize level objects in layers }~.

## Improved interoperability with linked viewports

When you enable a live camera link between Stingray and your Autodesk DCC tool (Maya, Maya LT, and 3ds Max), the acting master/slave viewport now switches automatically depending on which application is active. See ~{ Interop with Maya, Maya LT, or 3ds Max }~ for updated information.

![](../images/wn_couches_small.png)


## Updated Character template

An updated version of the Character template project is available in the ~{ Project Manager }~ when you start Stingray. Improvements include:

- the camera position
- the projectile Flow graph
- animation tree nodes
- Lua source code

![](../images/wn_charTemplate.png)

- ~{ Template projects }~

## Support for additional Android devices

The Stingray engine now supports Android devices equipped with Qualcomm Adreno 330, Adreno 420, and Adreno 430 chipsets. These GPUs are found in many devices, including Google Nexus devices, Amazon Kindle HDX series tablets, Amazon Fire phone, Nokia Lumia devices, Samsung Galaxy devices, Samsung Galaxy Note devices, Sony Xperia devices, and LG G2/G3 smartphones, and many more.

For updated information, refer to ~{ Supported platforms }~.

## iOS 9 binary size

Stingray now supports *only* iOS 9 targets. This change allows us to significantly decrease the size of the engine binaries.

## Light workflow improvements

You can now toggle the visibility of lights using the new light property **Enabled**. Disabling this option turns off the light's contribution in the current level and in the game.

In addition, hiding lights in the **Level Viewport** now hides only the visual representation of the light. It no longer turns the light off.

## Material workflow updates

### Smoother material import workflows

Importing assets with pre-assigned materials is now easier. When the new **Shared Materials** check box is turned on in the **FBX Import** window, Stingray searches your project for existing materials for the asset. If a match is found, Stingray applies the existing material to the asset on import.

For new information, see ~{ Import a model with textures and materials }~.

### Drag and drop materials in the viewport

Drag and drop a material from the **Asset Browser** onto an object in the **Level Viewport** to quickly assign a material to a unit in your level. You can also hover your cursor over an object to preview the material before itâ€™s assigned.

For new information, refer to ~{ Assign a material to an object }~.

### Better workflow when creating parent materials

When you click **Make Unique** in the **Property Editor** for a material, a new **Open Shader Graph** button displays, making it easy to start editing the shader graph. See ~{Create a parent material }~.

## Improved **Asset Browser** experience

Additional filtering and config options available in the **Asset Browser** let you toggle filters on and off, show file extensions, and set whether searches are case sensitive.

In addition, you can now move more than one asset at a time from folder to folder, and right-click to create new empty materials and animation controllers.

## More performance HUDs for visual debugging

New options in the **View > Performance HUD** menu (found in the **Level Viewport**) make it even easier to visually debug your game performance. You can now toggle the HUD display for the following categories:

- FPS
- Memory stats
- LUA performance
- Audio
- Culling performance
- Network performance
- Artist performance

![](../images/perfhud_network.png)

## Easier gameplay navigation in **Level Viewport**

When in gameplay navigation mode (right-click and hold in the **Level Viewport**), new hotkeys let you move the camera up (Q) and down (E).

See ~{ Navigate in the Level Viewport }~ for updated information.

## Improved editing in the **Property Editor**

You can now view and edit large amounts of script data in the **Property Editor**. Unit script data is displayed in an editable tree view, and supports number, string, and boolean values.

In addition, you can now edit multiple assets at the same time. For example, select multiple lights and adjust them all simultaneously.

## Simplified audio workflows

New drag and drop functionality lets you quickly add audio files to environments and characters. Simply drag an audio file from the **Property Editor** on to the animation timeline or in to your level, and then preview it directly in the editor, without playing your level. You can tweak your sound in Flow, using the corresponding logic that is created each time you add a sound.

## **Log Console** improvements

The ~{ Log Console }~ window now includes a filter widget that lets you filter out data from different components of Stingray, making it easier to debug issues. In addition, any errors and warnings that result when you select **Project > Run** now output directly to the **Log Console**. See ~{ Test a project }~.

## Updated PhysX plug-in

The PhysX plug-in installers for Maya, Maya LT, and 3ds Max that ship with Stingray are now updated to install the latest version of the PhysX plug-in, version 3.3.10930.12522. This plug-in includes several improvements and bug fixes by Nvidia. For related information, see ~{ Install the PhysX plug-in for your DCC }~.


## What else is new?

- Hotkey **Ctrl + P** launches the new **Omni Tool**, which lets you quickly access all assets and menu items in Stingray.
- The **Asset Preview** window now has a **View** menu that lets you show and hide grids, gizmos, bones, and meshes.
- The **Explorer** panel now has filters and categories to make it easier to navigate large levels with many objects in the tree view.
- The **File** menu now displays a list of recently opened levels.
- You can now paint in negative space in the Terrain tool, which makes it easier to create basins and valleys.
- A ~{ Documentation Archive }~ page is available if you plan to continue using an earlier version of Stingray or Scaleform Studio and you want to download documentation for previous versions. The Stingray online help always reflects the content and features of the current Stingray release.
- Support for *.stingrayignore* file. Use this file to list files and directories you want Stingray to ignore using a syntax similar to *.gitignore* files, then place the file in the root of your Stingray project. The data compiler will ignore these files when compiling your project resources. Note, however, that the Stingray Editor will still show the files in the **Asset Browser**.
- Launch Stingray in maximized windows mode on Windows
- PhysX heightfields are cooked to avoid long stalls when heightfields are spawned.
- Xbox One Multiplayer: Live Presence, Suspend/Resume, Voice chat, Invites, SmartMatch making
- LuaJIT interpreter support on Xbox One
- Allow to link dynamically against LuaJIT in Windows
- Updated to SteamWorks SDK 134

###Toggle the visibility of lights

Disable the new **Light** property, **Enabled**, to turn off a lightâ€™s contribution in the current level and in the game.

## Known Limitations

* * *

This section lists known limitations and workarounds for Stingray.

Unless otherwise noted in the **What's Fixed** section, please be aware that this release contains the same **Known Limitations** described in ~{ Stingray 1.0 Release Notes }~.

- **GAME-9185: Stingray Editor needs to support High DPI monitors**

	**Workaround:** If working with Stingray on a high resolution display, change your Display settings (in the Control Panel 'Appearance and Personalization' settings) to Larger (150%).

- **GAME-10794: Tank vehicles can cause crash if wheels are different shape/size**

	**Workaround:** If you configure vehicles as a tank type (with vehicle_physics_model = "tank" in the .physics json), ensure that you author tank wheels with identical shapes. If you need the visual meshes to be different sizes, configure them as children of the physics wheels.

- **GAME-10666: Newly added sounds/events do not work until Stingray is restarted**

	**Workaround:** Restart the engine (without restarting the editor) after you generate new sound banks. Hit 'Ctrl + F6' or select **Edit > Engine >  Restart Engine**

- **GAME-10584: Bundling Oculus projects does not work when Configuration is set to "Release"**

	**Workaround:** When packaging the project using the **Deployer** window, set **Configuration** to **Develop** instead.

- **GAME-10854 Transparent materials in old levels not rendering correctly**

	**Workaround:** Add a light source to the level and set it to be directional.

## Upgrade Requirements

* * *

The full installation guide for Autodesk products including Stingray is included in the Stingray online help, [here](http://www.autodesk.com/stingray-install-ENU "here").

This section explains the improvements and fixes that require specific upgrade steps for users currently using a previous version of Stingray.

## iOS 9 and Xcode 7

Stingray now supports *only* iOS 9 targets. If you develop for iOS, you must upgrade your Mac development machines to use Xcode 7.

## Script Flow node casing

Script Flow nodes no longer have their arguments and return values transformed into lower case by default.

Up until version 1.1, input values were transformed to lower case. For example, an input parameter named `MyInputValue` was available to the Lua script function as `t.myinputvalue`. Similarly, a return value named in the node definition as `MyOutputValue` used to be set from Lua as `r.myoutputvalue`. As of version 1.1, the casing specified in the *.script_flow_nodes* file is retained, so the variables used in Lua must now be `t.MyInputValue` and `r.MyOutputValue`.

You will need to make changes if:

-	Your project contains any script Flow nodes that contain any upper-case characters in the names of their input parameters or return values in the *.script_flow_nodes* JSON file,

-	OR your project uses Flow events that contain any upper-case characters in their names, whether in the *.script_flow_nodes* JSON file, the animation controller, or a level Story.

Alter either your Lua code or your node definition so that both use the same casing.

## Flow node changes

For a complete list of all new, modified, and removed Flow nodes in this release, see the [version history](../../flow_ref/versions.html).

If your project contains any of the Flow nodes that have been modified or removed, you will need to make sure that your graphs are wired correctly by deleting any old versions of the node and re-inserting the new version.

**Major changes:**

-	The **Camera > Get Active Camera** node provided by the Stingray Appkit is now a query node, which means that its In and Out events have been removed. This makes the node much more convenient to use, as its output values are fetched on demand whenever a downstream node requires those values.

-	Light nodes now allow you to specify the unit that owns the light.

-	HumanIK: The **Reference Target Bone** input of the **HumanIK > Character Add Constraints > HumanIK Add Aim** node is now a string (a bone name) instead of a bone index.

	The following errors can indicate that your project contains the old version of the HumanIK Add Aim node:

	- Test Engine / humanik plugin: character_declare_context: unspecified resource name (null or empty)
	- Test Engine / humanik plugin: character_declare_context: unspecified resource name (null or empty)
	- Test Engine / Lua: core/humanik/lua/humanik_flow_callbacks.lua:284: attempt to concatenate local 'unit' (a userdata value)

-	**Material > Get Mesh Material** has been replaced by **Material > Get Mesh Slot Material**.

## Lua API changes

For a complete list of all new, modified, and removed elements in the Lua API in this release, see the [version history](../../lua_ref/versions.html).

If your project contains any API elements that have been modified or removed, you will need to adjust your code accordingly.

**Major changes:**

-	New `Vector2` and `Vector4` object types have been added. These are temporary objects like the existing `Vector3` object, with their own `Vector2Box` and `Vector4Box` objects to store values across multiple frames. This change has several consequences, particularly for the `Gui` and `LineObject` objects.

-	Colors are now represented internally by `Vector4` objects instead of `Quaternion` objects. `stingray.Color()` returns a `Vector4`, and all functions in the `Gui` object that previously required color values expressed as a `Quaternion` now require a `Vector4`.

-	Functions that previously returned `Vector3` objects for 2D size values, such as `Gui.text_extents()`, now return `Vector2` objects instead. If you use any of these functions, make sure that your code treats the returned objects as `Vector2` values instead of `Vector3`. If you see the message:

	>	*attempt to perform arithmetic on field 'z' (a nil value).*

	it may indicate that your code is treating a returned `Vector2` value as if it were still a `Vector3`.

-	Functions that previously accepted `Vector3` objects for 2D sizes now require `Vector2` objects instead. If you see the message:

	>	*The size parameter for Gui functions is a Vector2 and not a Vector3.*

	it may indicate that you are still passing a `Vector3` into a function that now expects a `Vector2`.

-	The *position* parameter of 2D `Gui` functions used to always be a `Vector3` that grouped the 2D position and the draw layer. If you want to use layer 0, you can now use a `Vector2` instead. This allows you to simplify the parameter initialization from `Vector3(x, y, 0)` to `Vector2(x, y)`.

-	Several items in the Navigation interface have changed, including the `GwNavBot` and `GwNavAStar` objects.

## Oculus SDK upgrade

Stingray's Oculus plugin has been updated to use SDK 0.7.0.0-beta.

To run correctly, you'll need to download and install the latest Oculus runtime for windows and verify that your graphics card is compatible to install VR beta drivers. See details at https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/pc/0.7.0.0-beta/Oculus_Runtime_for_Windows/.

Since this is a major revision, previous VR templates will not work. Expect to port any previous projects to use the new template.

## `render_config` files

Because we streamlined the data compiler code, *.package* files for *.render_config* resources are no longer automatically generated.

If you have created custom *.render_config* files for any projects or plug-ins, create a *.package* file in the same folder as your *.render_config* file, with the same name. In the *.package* file, add the full path to your *.render_config* file, without the file extension:

~~~{sjson}
render_config = [ "<full path to render_config>" ]
~~~

For example, for the existing file 'core/stingray_renderer/renderer.render_config', add a new file 'core/stingray_renderer/renderer.package', with the following contents:

~~~{sjson}
render_config = [ "core/stingray_renderer/renderer" ]
~~~

Without this update, the data compilation fails with an error about the missing package file.

## Source updates

* * *

## Source re-organization

The Stingray repository has been re-organized and refactored for clarity and consistency.

-	All runtime code has been moved under a single `runtime` folder.
-	Nested folders in the hierarchy with redundant names (such as `application/application`) have been simplified.
-	Editor code files are moving to lower-case file naming.
-	All code specific to private platforms has been re-located under `runtime/platforms`. If you have access to closed repositories, you will notice that the code in the repositories is now nested under a `runtime/platforms` folder.

## Default binary output location

The build process now puts the generated files under `build/binaries`.

## Build system updates libraries by default

The `make.rb` script now automatically updates your library directory with the latest versions of all the dependencies you need in order to carry out the build configuration you've requested. Now, all you need to do in order to do a full Windows build of the engine and editor is run `make.rb` with no arguments.

## Package manager

The Stingray Package Manager, or `spm`, actually introduced in version 1.0.1, simplifies the management of third-party library dependencies. It is used automatically by the Stingray build system to keep your library requirements up to date; you can also invoke it on the command line yourself. See the [Developer Help](http://www.autodesk.com/stingray-help?contextId=DEVELOPER_HOME) for more details, or run `spm --help`.

## Plug-in changes

-	The resource manager plug-in API now allows type-specific callback registration.
-	Added Android LifeCycle Event API.
-	New shared `plugin_foundation` header-only library to ease the development of plug-ins.
-	While developing a plug-in on Windows, you can now specify a hot-reload directory for your plug-ins. When the engine detects that a DLL file in that directory has changed, it will immediately reload the plug-in and begin using the newer version. Set the directory by calling the `stingray.Application.set_plugin_hot_reload_directory()` Lua function in your gameplay code or in the Stingray Editor.
