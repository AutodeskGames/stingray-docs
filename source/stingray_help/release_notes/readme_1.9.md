## What's New

## Texture Manager improvements

Continuing the improvements from the previous release, the **Texture Manager** tool is looking better than ever. The platform list looks crisp and compact, and headers added to the texture view list lets you view textures in an organized manner. You can organize your textures in the Texture Manager by sorting them by size, date modified or name. The Texture Manager also now preserves the state of UI layout you adjust like filters enabled or resized filter views.
