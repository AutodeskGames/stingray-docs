# Dependency tool

- **Window > Dependency**

Use the **Dependency** tool to find which assets are used in a level, which are not used, to check file dependencies, and to easily replace files. 

As you select an asset, the **Dependency** tool lists the assets that use the selected asset and the assets used by the selected asset.
