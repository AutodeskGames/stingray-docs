**Part 1: Switching between cameras**

In the first video of this series, you'll learn about creating custom cameras, and switching between active cameras.

**Part 2: Creating camera aim constraints**

Learn how to constrain the camera's rotation to point at a game character.

**Part 3: Creating camera movement constraints**

Shows you how to convert a camera into a 3rd person perspective camera that is constrained to the character's position.

**Part 4: Creating an orbit constraint**

Builds on the move constraint applied in Part 3 and implements a camera orbit constraint, so that the camera position is influenced by both the target object position and the camera's rotation around the target unit.
