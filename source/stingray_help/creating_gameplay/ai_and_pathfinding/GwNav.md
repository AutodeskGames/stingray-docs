# Gameware Navigation

Autodesk Gameware Navigation is a middleware for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 3D video games and simulations: it helps your game-controlled characters (NPCs) find and follow paths from place to place in the game world, avoiding collisions with each other and with other dynamic obstacles; and it provides spatial analysis tools for getting information about the game world.

The Gameware Navigation plug-in adds the following capabilities to Stingray:

*	You can automatically create navigation meshes for your levels in the Stingray editor.
*	You can spawn bots in your game at runtime, and make them find and follow paths from place to place in the level.
*	In your Lua or Flow code, you can conduct high-performance spatial queries against the navigation data, and use the results to drive gameplay.
