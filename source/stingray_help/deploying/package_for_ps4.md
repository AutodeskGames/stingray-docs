# Packaging a game for PlayStation 4

To package a project for PlayStation 4:

1.	If you haven't done so already, set up the ~{ Requirements for PlayStation 4 game development }~ on your Windows computer.
2.	In the Stingray Editor, open the **Deployer** panel to the PlayStation 4 tab and enter the required information. (See below.)
3.	Click **Package Project for PlayStation 4**.

Stingray copies the files your game needs to the location on your computer that you specify in the **Destination** field.

After deploying from Stingray, you can use the development tools provided by Sony to copy your game to a PlayStation device for testing, and to finish preparing your game for distribution using any of the channels supported by Sony.
