# Packaging a game for Xbox One

To package a project for Xbox One:

1.	If you haven't done so already, follow the first-time setup instructions under ~{ Get started on Xbox One }~.
2.	In the Stingray Editor, open the **Deployer** panel to the Xbox tab and enter the required information. (See below.)
3.	Click **Package Project for Xbox One**.

Stingray copies the files your game needs to the location on your computer that you specify in the **Destination** field.

After deploying from Stingray, you can use the development tools provided by Microsoft to copy your game to an Xbox One device for testing, and to finish preparing your game for distribution using any of the channels supported by Microsoft.
