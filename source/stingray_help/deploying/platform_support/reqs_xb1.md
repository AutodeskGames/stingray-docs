# Requirements for Xbox One game development

In order to connect the Stingray Editor to an Xbox One device, or to build and deploy your game for Xbox One, you must follow the steps listed on this page on your Windows development machine.

## Stingray Xbox One distribution

The parts of Stingray related to Xbox One are only distributed to teams that are registered with Microsoft as Xbox One developers. You need to get this distribution and install it on your computer.

Registered Xbox One developers can download the distribution from the Autodesk Game Developer Center, at <http://gamedev.autodesk.com/>.

If you need to register for a new account, or if you need to add Xbox One access rights to your account, you can do so through the site.

## Xbox One platform SDK

On your Windows development machine, install the XDK: the Xbox One platform libraries. You need the **November 2015** release. Other versions may or may not be compatible.

You can download the SDK from the Microsoft Game Developer Network Portal, available to registered developers at <https://developer.xboxlive.com/>.
