# Debugging Wwise content

You can connect the Wwise authoring tool to a running instance of your Stingray game. Once connected, you can see real time information in the profiler layout and the 3D object layout. The following features provide powerful game audio workflows:

- The log shows all inputs to the Wwise engine, and any error message or warnings.
- You can get profiling information to monitor and debug performance.
- You can use a visual graph to see the state of all active Wwise objects.
- The 3D world viewer visualizes sources and events in real-time.
- Recording and playback allows for advanced debugging and mastering without needing to replay the game simulation.
