## To add audio sources to an animation controller

Adding audio events to clips and animation controllers triggers Wwise audio automatically. The audio sources play back when the clip is played.

2. Drag and drop and audio source onto the timeline of the selected state in the **Anim Controller Editor**. A new flow event is created for the audio event.
