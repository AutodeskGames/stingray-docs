# Create a texture template

A texture template is a file in your project that looks like a normal texture file (in terms of file format), usually set up by the technical artist on a project team.

You can create texture templates to quickly configure imported textures without having to use the **Texture Manager**. For example, you can define a texture template for special textures like normal maps and always use that template when importing new normal map textures.

To create a new template:

1. Select one (and only one) texture in the **Texture Manager**.
2. Select **File > Save Settings As Template**.

	The window that appears shows how the actual template file will look internally, what settings it will contain for each platform, and what settings they have in common.

3. Click **OK** to save this as a new texture template.

4. In the **Save As** dialog box, ensure that you save the texture template within your project and give it a good name, since the interface name is based on this file name.

Once saved, your texture template is available within the **Quick Texture Import** window. See ~{ Import textures }~.
