# Edit Texture settings

1. Open the **Texture Manager** (**Window > Texture Manager**).

2. At the top of the **Texture Manager**, set the filters to refine the content you want to browse in the window.
	(For example, you can filter by **Category** or **Texture Output Format**.)
	For information on adding your own category for filtering, see ~{ Create a texture category }~.

3. Select one or more textures in the browser to edit.

4. On the right, use the **Platforms to Edit** panel to select all the platforms where you want to apply edits.

5. Edit the texture settings. (Refer to ~{ Texture Manager }~ for more details on the settings available.)

6. When you are pleased with your changes, select **File > Save Selected** or **File > Save All** from the **Texture Manager** menu bar. This saves and recompiles your textures.
