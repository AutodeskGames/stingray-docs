# Register as a Stingray developer

In order to access the Stingray source code, you must set up user accounts for GitHub and for the Autodesk Gamedev portal, if you don't already have them. Then, you have to request access to the Stingray source on the Gamedev site.

## Register for GitHub

Stingray source code is distributed through private repositories on GitHub. In order to get access to the repositories, you must have a GitHub user account. If you do not already have one, sign up for free here:

<http://www.github.com>

## Register for a Gamedev developer account

If you do not already have a developer account at the Autodesk Gamedev portal, create a new account here:

<https://gamedev.autodesk.com/>

If you already have an Autodesk account, you can use your Autodesk ID and password to register. If not, we'll ask you to create one.

## Link your Gamedev and GitHub accounts

Once you have access to the developer area of the Gamedev portal, you need to tell us your GitHub username so that we can give your GitHub account the right to access the source code repositories.

1.  Click your name and select **Profile**.

2.  Enter your GitHub account name in the *GitHub Username* field, and click **Save**.

## Create a new company and project

If you don't already have a company and a project set up on the Gamedev site, make sure you set those up now. These help manage what products you have access to.

## Request Stingray source access

Finally, e-mail <gamedev@autodesk.com> to request access to Stingray source for your new project.

When your Autodesk account is granted access rights to the Stingray project, your GitHub user account is also granted access to the Stingray source code repository on GitHub. You will receive a notification by e-mail. You can then carry on with the next steps listed under ~{ Getting started with source access }~.
