# User accounts

In order to access the Stingray source code, you must set up user accounts for the following sites.

## Register for GitHub

Stingray source code is distributed through private repositories on GitHub. In order to get access to the repositories, you must have a GitHub user account. If you do not already have one, sign up for free here:

<http://www.github.com>

## Set up your Gamedev developer account

If you do not already have a developer account at the Autodesk Gamedev portal, register here:

<https://gamedev.autodesk.com/>

If you already have an Autodesk 360 account, you can use your Autodesk ID and password to register. If you do not have an Autodesk account, you will be prompted to create one.

## Link your Gamedev account to your GitHub account

Once you have access to the developer area of the Gamedev portal, request Stingray source code access for your project. You must also tell us your GitHub username so that we can give your GitHub account the right to access the source code repositories.

1.  Sign in to the portal at <http://gamedev.autodesk.com>

2.  Click your name and select **Projects**.

3.  Select an existing project or create a new one using the **Create New Project** tab.

4.  Email <gamedev@autodesk.com> to request access to Stingray source.

5.  Once granted Stingray access, click your name and select **Profile**.

6.  Enter your GitHub account name in the *GitHub Username* field, and click **Save**.

When your Autodesk account is granted access rights to the Stingray project, your GitHub user account is also granted access to the Stingray source code repository. You will receive a notification by e-mail.
