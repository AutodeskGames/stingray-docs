# Getting started with source access

The topics in this section will get you up and running with the Stingray source code:

1.	Make sure that you install all the ~{ Software requirements }~.

2.	Register for and set up all the ~{ User accounts }~ you need.

3.	Decide on your ~{ Source code management }~ strategy. This section provides some information about the Autodesk repositories, and suggestions for how to work with them.

4.	Once you have a revision of the Stingray source code residing on your local computer, you need to understand how to get the ~{ Library dependencies }~ you need in order to rebuild Stingray binaries from the source code.

After you have completed these steps, you should be ready to start building and developing with the source code.
