# Getting started with source access

The topics in this section will get you up and running with the Stingray source code:

1.	You'll need to ~{ Register as a Stingray developer }~. This involves creating some (free) user accounts and requesting source access from Autodesk.

2.	Make sure that you install all the ~{ Software requirements }~ for all the platforms you want your project to run on.

3.	Once you are granted access to the code on GitHub, you'll have to decide on a ~{ Source code management }~ strategy for your organization. This section provides some information about the Autodesk repositories, and suggestions for how to work with them.

4.	Once you have a revision of the Stingray source code residing on your local computer, you need to understand how to get the ~{ Library dependencies }~ you need in order to rebuild Stingray binaries from the source code.

After you have completed these steps, you should be ready to start ~{ Building Stingray from source }~ and developing with the source code.
